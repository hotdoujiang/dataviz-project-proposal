# Data Visualization Project

## Data

The data I propose to visualize for my project is downloaded from [Heritage Organization](https://www.heritage.org/index/about)

>The Economic Freedom Index is poised to help readers track over two decades of the advancement in economic freedom, prosperity, and opportunity and promote these ideas in their homes, schools, and communities. The Index covers 12 freedoms – from property rights to financial freedom – in 186 countries. <br>

The attributes are
* Country Name
* Region
* World Rank
* Region Rank
* 2019 Score
* Property Rights
* Judical Effectiveness
* Government Integrity
* Tax Burden
* Gov't Spending
* Fiscal Health
* Business Freedom
* Labor Freedom
* Monetary Freedom
* Trade Freedom
* Investment Freedom
* Financial Freedom

## Prototypes

I’ve created a proof of concept visualization of this data. It's a ... and it shows ...

(please put a screenshot of one or more visualizations of this dataset you already made, for previous assignments)

## Questions & Tasks

The following tasks and questions will drive the visualization and interaction decisions for this project:

* How is the economic freedom distribution around the world? Is there any region pattern?
* Which are the top countries who have the most tax burden?
* Is there any relationship between trade freedom and the country location? i.e. whether it is a inland country or not?

## Sketches

(insert one or more hand-drawn sketches of interactive visualizations that you imagine)
(describe each sketch - how is the data visualized, what are the interactions, and how do these relate to the questions/tasks)

## Open Questions

(describe any fear, uncertainty, or doubt you’re having about the feasibility of implementing the sketched system. For example, “I’m not sure where to get the geographic shapes to build a map from this data” or “I don’t know how to resolve the codes to meaningful names” … Feel free to delete this section if you’re confident.)
